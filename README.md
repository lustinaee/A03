Part 1: Directions on using WebStorm

Sign up for an account on **GitHub**. As for WebStorm and **Git**, download and install the latest version from their respective websites. Once they are finished installing, go to the system preferences in WebStorm. Go to Version Control and then **Git**. Enter the path to your git.exe file in the "Path to Git executable" bar.

Click on "Create New Project". After selecting a location and name, proceed and click on File -> New -> HTML File -> HTML 5. After editing your file, go to VCS -> Import into Version Control -> Create Git Repository. Hit OK and then select VCS->Git -> Commit File. Click **Commit** to save your changes.

Now we will move onto **GitHub**. Select VCS -> Import into Version Control -> Share Project on Github. Enter the necessary information and hit "Share". If successful, then the **repository** should pop up in your **GitHub** account. This is how **Git** works in tandem with **GitHub** and WebStorm. Within your newly added **repository**, you can also add additional files such as a readme. You can do so towards the top where it says README.md. To create a new **repository** on **GitHub**, on the left panel, click on the green "New" button. On the next page, you can name your **repository** as well as set it to public/private, add a readme with it, etc.
